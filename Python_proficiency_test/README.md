- This proficiency test of Python consisted of a total of 23 questions.

- 22 of these were short-response questions. They were two formats - write out the expected output of a program, and spot and fix an error in a program. One question required an algorithm to be designed and implemented it in Python.

- Participants were given 1 hour to attempt these questions.

- This test was administered before participants were administered the main fMRI-based experiments. There was no overlap between questions on this test and the stimuli presented in the experiments.

- `assessment.pdf` was the test we handed out to the participants. `latex/main.tex` has the LaTeX for the questions in the test.
