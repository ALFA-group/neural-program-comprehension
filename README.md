## Folder structure

### Stimuli
All stimuli related content is available in `stimuli/`.

We have made available stimuli pertaining to the three conditions we test in our work -
- `EN`: Codes with variable names in English.
- `SENT`: English descriptions of these codes.
- `JAP`: Codes with obfuscated variable names.

They have been made available in two formats - CSVs and raw Python scripts, available at `./stimuli/python_files/` and `./stimuli/python_files/` respectively.

In `./stimuli/python_files/`, we have shared three files each containing all the XXX stimuli, and three folders each containing individual files for the XXX stimuli across the three conditions.
