\question
You are given a grid of \texttt{1}s and \texttt{0}s. Your job is to find out the number of \textit{clusters} of \texttt{1}s in it.\\
A \texttt{1} belongs to a \textit{cluster} if it has a \texttt{1} in either of the four positions - above, below, to its right, or to its left.
A \texttt{1} surrounded by 0s in the four positions represents a \textit{cluster} by itself.
For example, 
\begin{Verbatim}
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1
\end{Verbatim}
has 4 \textit{clusters}, with each isolated \texttt{1} forming one cluster, while 
\begin{Verbatim}
1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1
\end{Verbatim}
has 2 \textit{clusters}.
\newline \newline
You will be given a two-dimensional matrix containing \texttt{1}s and \texttt{0}s. You are required to return an integer denoting the number of \textit{clusters} in the matrix.
