You are given three lists: [12, 34, 36, 71, 3, 42], [53, 23, 16, 24, 5, 15], and [1, 34, 10, 91, 43, 26]. You think of a random number: 34. If the number exists in the first list or is present in both, the second and third lists, you write down the first number in the first list. Else, if the number is in the second list, or is present in both, the third and first lists, you write out the first number of the second list. Else, if the number is in the third list or is present in both, the first and second lists, you write out the first number of the third list. What number do you write out?
