You are provided a list of numbers [4, 5, 3, 8, 3, 2, 5]. You calculate the integer part of the quotient obtained when the length of the list is divided by 2. Starting from 0, you access indices from the list one by one up to the quotient you calculated (inclusive). For each index you access, you find the number at that index, and cumulatively sum them up. What is the resulting value?
