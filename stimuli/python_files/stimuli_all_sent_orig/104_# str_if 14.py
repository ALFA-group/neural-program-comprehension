You are provided the sentence "I am a" and a word "cat". If the number of letters in the word is greater than 3, you write down the word. Else, if the last letter of the sentence is the same as the second letter of the word, you write down the sentence. Otherwise, you write down the concatenation of the sentence, a space, and the word. What do you write down?
