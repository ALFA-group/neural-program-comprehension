Data used for final statistical analyses & plots. 
Neuroimaging results are produced using the spm_ss toolbox (based on Matlab; contact annaiv@mit.edu or evelina9@mit.edu if you're interested in running the toolbox analyses)

Directories:
- data_fROI: Main results. Responses to conditions of interest in predefined MD/language parcels
- data_GSS: Responses in fROIs defined with group-constrained subject-specific analyses (GcSS; Fedorenko et al, 2010).
- data_spcorr: Spatial correlation analysis (voxel-level spatial correlation in response profiles to conditions of interests in predefined parcels) 
- data_beh: participants' behavioral responses

Tasks and labels for conditions of interest:
- langlocSN: language localizer (S - sentence reading, N - nonword reading)
- spatialFIN: MD localizer; spatial memory task (H - hard, E - easy)
- brainCode: Python program comprehension (en - code problems, English identifiers, jap - code problems, Japanese identifiers, sent - sentence problems) 
- scratchJr: ScratchJr program comprehension (crit_CODE - code problems, crit_VERB - sentence problems)

See the paper for a more detailed description of the analyses.
